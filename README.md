# Module7-Challenge: Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on an employee data for a company with over 300,000 employees. The company, called Pewlett Hackard, wants to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Dataset:
There are six original csv files:[original dataset](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module7-Challenge/tree/main/data) and four output dataset [Output_Dataset](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module7-Challenge/tree/main/csv).

![retiring_dept](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module7-Challenge/blob/main/image/retiring_dept.PNG?raw=true)  
The departemtns of *Development*, * Production* and *Sales* have the largest three number of retiring employees.  
The following table is the number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program of each department.  
![mentorship_dept](https://github.com/cffhr99/Module7-Challenge/blob/main/image/mentorship_eligibilty_dept_name.PNG?raw=true)  
Comparing two tables above, even the departemtns of *Development*,  *Production* and *Sales* hold a large amount of retiring employees, they still have enough people to mentor the next generation employees. However, the departments of *Finance*, *Quality Management* and *Human Resources* have the smallest number of employees to train next generation employees.
